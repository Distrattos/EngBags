# EngInventory
EngInventory, first made by Engival, then edited by Baroque, now by me.  An edit of an edit of what is basically an edit of the default interface.  Play the Inception music.

# Differences Between Baroque's Edit and Mine
- I extend bag slot support from 128 to 160, which (to my understanding) is the current max at Turtle WoW.
- I include a bag bar at the top of the frame, next to the edit button.

# Known Issues
- If you take a bag out of a slot and don't replace it, the icon stays there.  This fixes itself on reload, relog, or just placing a new bag there.  Not a serious issue so I'm not gonna bother trying to fix it.
